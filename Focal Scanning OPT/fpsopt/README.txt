###### Description #######

This package includes Matlab code implementing our FPS-OPT reconstruction algorithm described in the paper,

K. G. Chan and M. Liebling, "Direct inversion algorithm for focal plane scanning optical projection tomography," in Biomedical Optics Express, vol. 8, no. 11, pp. 5349-5358, 2017.


###### Installation ######

While this package does not require any installation (besides adding the folder to the Matlab path), it requires the SPLRadon package, which can be downloaded at:

http://sybil.ece.ucsb.edu/pages/splineradon/splineradon.html

The SPLRadon package requires some MEX compilation. Please see the README file included with the SPLRadon package for more information.


###### Usage ######

Sample data can be downloaded at: http://sybil.ece.ucsb.edu/pages/fpsopt/
Simply download the sample data, place it into this folder (so Matlab can find it), and run the script 'main.m'!
